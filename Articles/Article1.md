# Preface
In [another article]() I covered some of the history of how the WHATWG HTML Living Standard came to be. In this article I will give a brief overview of the contents of the WHATWG HTML Living Standard, describing its main divisions and sub-divisions.

## Introduction
The Introduction has multiple parts, which explain where this specification fits, who the audience is, and what the scope is. It also comments on the relation of this document to HTML5, provides background and history, and provides a few sections on design notes, clarifying what could be confusing aspects of the document. Nearer the end, the Introduction section contains comments on the differences between HTML and XML syntax, and gives its on commentary on the rest of the Living Standard. The final subsections contain a quick introduction to HTML, conformance requirements for authors, and suggested further reading.

<!-- Section 1.6 should be referenced in a larger article, which should rely on external sources. -->
<!-- Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and possible 1.7 should be the content of their own article. -->
<!-- Section 1.9 should be referenced in passing, and should be the basis for further commentary on each of these subsections. -->
<!-- Sections 1.8, 1.10, and 1.11 should be the content for one or more articles, working as a series if needed. -->
<!-- Section 1.12 should probably just be mentioned in passing, but I should check out the resources. -->
